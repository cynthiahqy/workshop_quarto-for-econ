-   **Currently:** PhD candidate in EBS
-   **Previously:** Economics at Unimelb, SoDa Labs
-   Passionate about research workflows, communication and transparency

## About the Tools

-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org) for collating scientific and technical research inputs into polished documents
-   [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) for editing and rendering Quarto documents and websites
-   [git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com) for publishing your Quarto website
-   (optional) [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)
-   (optional) R, python, or Julia

## Workshop Goals {.small}

::: notes
This workshop will be a little bit different to your standard Intro to Quarto workshop. We will not cover computation in Quarto
:::

We will focus on:

-   features of Quarto that can help you document research code and data:
    -   incorporate existing text files (scripts, table outputs etc.) <!-- includes -->
    -   reference management -- e.g. in-line citations, cross-references, figure and table numbers <!--- citations -->
    -   generate summary tables and overviews from listing files <!--- listings --->
-   how to publish and share Quarto projects online

We will not dive into:

- computation in Quarto (i.e. R, Python, Julia or Observable)

## Workshop Expectations {.smaller}

-   work with small-medium data

-   regularly write and debug code

-   know some basic LaTex and have heard of markdown

-   can use and edit a template even if you don't fully understand what it is doing

# What is Quarto?

## Quarto ...

-   is a new, open-source, scientific, and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

Illustrated by Allison Horst.](images/horst_quarto_schematic.png){fig-alt="A schematic representing the multi-language input (e.g. Python, R, Observable, Julia) and multi-format output (e.g. PDF, html, Word documents, and more) versatility of Quarto." fig-align="center"}

## Quarto ...

-   is a new, open-source, scientific, and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

::: incremental
-   includes a [visual markdown editor](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/) for WYSISYG editing
-   is a command line interface (CLI) that the renders plain text formats (`.qmd`, `.rmd`, `.md`) into static PDF/Word/HTML reports, books, websites, presentations and more.

## My Turn: A Tour of Quarto in VSCode

<!--- TODO: MY TURN --->

::: notes
Show off features: 

- this website and slides
- article
- wiki template
:::

## Follow Along: my_first_doc.qmd {.smaller}

::: notes
we won't go in-depth with markdown features, but explore and ask questions!

- new project from day01-exercises
- new file in Rstudio
- remove CODE chunks & focus on Markdown Features
- use Help \> Markdown Quick Reference
- visual mode \<--\> source mode
- formats - HTML, PDF, docx, pptx
- render options
- preview in pane, or window
- render on save
- show terminal: quarto command line interface - `quarto render my_first_doc.qmd` - `quarto preview my_first_doc.qmd`

:::

::: task
-   Create and Open a new folder in VSCode
-   Use the command palette to create a new document in **Visual** mode.
-   Replace the Code section with your own content.
-   Render the document then switch to **Source** mode. Save the file as `my_first_doc.qmd`
-   Re-render and compare changes with your neighbours.
-   Take note of any features you would like to know more about.
:::

## Rendering Options in VSCode

1. **Option 1:** Press the Render button

. . .

2. **Option 2:** In the Terminal via `quarto render`:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

quarto render document.qmd # defaults to html
quarto render document.qmd --to pdf
quarto render document.qmd --to docx
```

## Under the Hood {.smaller}

![](images/rstudio-qmd-how-it-works.png)

::: incremental
-   The `quarto` package calls the Quarto command line interface (CLI) -- `quarto render my_doc.qmd`
-   any R/Python/Julia code or features are evaluated by `knitr` or `jupyter` which return a `.md` file along with the evaluated code
-   Quarto applies [Lua](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/lua.html) filters + CSS/LaTeX which is then evaluated alongside the `.md` file by Pandoc and converted to a final output format
